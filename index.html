        <p>If covered: "Perfect, just to help slow down the calls, was that through work or the Marketplace?"</p>
        <p>If Obamacare: "Are you getting any financial assistance through that? Any pre-existing conditions?"</p>
        <p>If Employer: "How much are you paying? And is that just for you or family too?"</p>
        <p>If Private/Limited: "Those usually cap benefits. Were you aware of that?"</p>
    </div>
